                            <strong>Objective:</strong> To design and test a game that exposes players to 
                            the complications that penguins face when searching for food

                        <p>
                            Like many other animals, penguins eat fish. Because more than one species 
                            eats fish, penguins have to fight for their food. However, penguins are both 
                            predators to fish and prey to many other species. In this project, a team of two
                            was tasked to design and test a game that exposes players to the complications
                            that penguins face when searching for food. We experienced many different challenges
                            trying to make the different levels. We constantly ran into problems when building 
                            the obstacles, only in the end to find out that a block was misplaced or something
                            was not inputted correctly. In the end we developed a working and challenging game
                            that completes our objective.

                            In this project, I assisted in the designing, programming, and testing of bridges and 
                            documented a large portion of the project. I contributed to the initial designing of the 
                            project, assisted in programming, typed up the majority of the documentation (Daily log 
                            and Daily Reflection, Brainstorming, Diagram/Flow-Chart, Instructions on How to Play, and
                            my portion of the Conclusion Questions). For further information on the project, the

                                <strong>Objective:</strong> To design and test an app that would attract 
                                users to space exploration.

                                In this project, a team of two was tasked to design and test an app that 
                                would attract players to play a space exploration game using MIT App 
                                Inventor. We faced many challenges in this project as the game was
                                not working in the way that we intended. For example, we wanted to make it 
                                so that the food in the game would drop every couple cycles; however, 
                                the food would just continually drop down in every cycle. We fixed this by 
                                changing the timer and the scale in which it dropped, leaving the program able
                                to drop the food every couple cycles. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In this project, I was mainly the programmer and the tester. I programmed a
                                a majority of the game and came up with many of the solutions to problems that 
                                kept occuring. I also tested the game many times to make sure that the product 
                                works. Though I participated less documentation, I contributed to the initial 
                                design of the game. For further information on the project, the document link 
                                is available. Please note that the highlighted portions are the sections I

                            only in the end to find out that an extra key was pressed incorrectly. In the end we developed a working and challenging game
                            that completes our objective. This project helped further my skills in testing and trouble shooting code because of the constant challenges we faced.
