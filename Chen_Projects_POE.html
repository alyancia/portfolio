                            mechanism to move heavy objects up 3 floors.

                        <p>
                            To lift heavy objects up three floors, a team of four was tasked to 
                            build a mechanism out of VEX or FT parts and to program a NetLogo 
                            stimulation. This project was very fast paced and also challenging. 
                            Occasionally, our stimulation would stop working because of a typing 
                            error and the system would be unable to read it. We also had to constantly 
                            adjust our original design because there was a lack of parts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this project, I was mainly the documenter and the programmer. As the 
                            documenter, I did a majority of the summaries and annotations for the 
                            pictures and did most of the calculations. As the programmer, I programmed 
                            a large portion of the stimulation. Though I did participate in the design 
                            process of the vehicle, I did not physically participate in the building 
                            process. For further information on the project, the document link is available.

                                <strong>Objective:</strong> To design, create, and test a vehicle 
                                that runs on solar or hydrogen fuel cells.

                                Because of the decreasing amount of non renewable fuel cells, 
                                engineers have been coming up with ways for vehicles to fun on 
                                alternative energy. In this project, a team of four were to design 
                                and test a vehicle built using VEX or FT materials that ran on 
                                solar or hydrogen fuel cells. Though the solar cells were easy and 
                                convenient to use, we ran into many challenges with the hydrogen 
                                cell. There were occasions where a fully charged hydrogen cell would 
                                not move the vehicle, even though there were no issues with the 
                                vehicle's mechanics. However, we realized that we needed to change 
                                our gear ratio for the sprocket system and after the problem was 
                                resolved, the hydrogen power vehicle was running.

                                In this project, I was mainly the documenter where I worked on 
                                calculations, annotations, and summation of data. I did participate 
                                in the design process of the vehicle; however, did not physically 
                                build too much of it. For further information on the project, the

                            Bridges are needed to cross valleys, rivers, and many different landscapes. 
                            In this project, a team of one to three was tasked to design and test a 
                            stable, 2 lane, and low cost bridge using a stimulation program called West 
                            Point Bridge Design. There were not many challenges in this project as most 
                            of it was testing different bridge designs. We had to switch many of the 
                            materials we originally wanted to use of the bridge design to reduce the cost. 
                            It was difficult to find a perfect balance of cost and stability but after 
                            experimenting with the system, we managed to find a stable yet low cost bridge.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this project, I assisted in the designing and testing of bridges and 
                            documented a large portion of the project. I designed the final design 
                            solution and typed up the design modifications along with the final design 
                            summary. For further information on the project, the document link is

                                In this project, a team of four was tasked to solve one of eight design 
                                problems using only VEX or FT materials and RobotC. The problem that our 
                                team decided to address was to make a delivery vehicle that moves back 
                                and forth based on a potentiometer input. During this project, we faced 
                                many challenges. We had to find enough wire to connect the motors and 
                                the buttons on the vehicle to the separate remote that we had created 
                                and later had to connect all of them to their correct ports. Furthermore, 
                                we had issues with our program that we needed to constantly address to 
                                make the vehicle move. We often had to think of the stability and strength 
                                of the vehicle because it ultimately had to carry something on its back; 
                                therefore, many of our designs had to be altered to accommodate this.

                                In this project, I was mainly the documenter and the tester. I typed up the 
                                designs, the design modifications, final solution summary and the 
                                annotations for most of the pictures. I also tested the prototype many times 
                                to make sure that the product works. Though I participated less in the 
                                building process, I contributed to the design process. For further 
                                information on the project, the document link is available. Please note that 
                                the highlighted portions are the sections I took the most leadership role in 
                                or had the most team work in.
