                            This project was an individual project and was designed to help us explore more about the 3D printing process
                            and learn its limitations. This project required a lot of creativity and fast 
                            learning to adjust to a new machine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this project, I brainstormed several ideas I had in my engineering notebook and
                            sketched each of them out. I wanted something creative and detailed, so I chose the 
                            biohazard symbol design I drew. I faced challenges through out this project because 
                            it was my first time using inventor so I had to constantly ask those around me for help. 
                            However, I quickly learned the process and adjusted to it. My original design was a one
                            sided design but I thought it would more intricate and interesting if I did the symbol 
                            on both sides of the circle plate. Once I printed the design and put it in the tank to 
                            allow the support material to disolve, the part was done. I did the entire documentation 
                            myself, including the original brainstorming design, the AutoDesk Inventor design, and 
                            then the picture of the final product. For further information on the project, the
                            document link is available.

                                I brainstormed several ideas I had in my engineering notebook and
                                sketched each of them out. I wanted something stencil-like so I designed a pair of flowers. 
                                I faced challenges through out this project because I had to make sure that nothing was accidentally
                                cut and that there was enough support for the stencil be strong.
                                I did the entire documentation myself, including the original brainstorming design, the CorelDraw design, and

                        <p>
                            In this project, we were tasked to work in teams of two or three to design 
                            and build a marble action game. It needed to be fabricated using the laser 
                            cutter and could be assembled using glue and VEX parts. We were each given 
                            a sheet of mat board (12” x 12” x .055”), 1 piece of ⅛” basswood (3” x 24” x .125”), 
                            1 piece of felt (6” x 9”), 1 piece of birch tongue depressors (6” x .75” x .065), 
                            marbles (approx 9/16” dia), and rubber bands. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We decided to make a sliding picture game and found a picture of a dragon on google
                            to make our picture out of. We cut the picture into 9 boxes to make the sliding tiles 
                            and printed it on the basswood. For the frame to put the tiles in, we used the matboard 
                            and created a square for the base and four rectangles for the perimeter, connecting 
                            it all with wood glue. Though the cutting process and the assembly process went 
                            smoothly, when we put the parts into the frame, it did not slide smoothly. Therefore, we 
                            sanded to corners of each tile so it was rounded and it slide much more smoothly. I finished 
                            the documentation on my own.

                                our own business cards.

                                For this project, I recieved a icy blue, 3" by 2" sheet of acrylic plastic for 
                                the final product. Wanting to have the design on the business card match the color of 
                                the material, I decided to go for ice skates and snowflakes as a decorative factor. 
                                I put my name, number, and email, but later thought my business card looked empty, so I 
                                decided to add my Instagram too. I put the icons to represent each - phone, mail, and the 
                                instagram logo - and added my decorative factor next to it. I cut the snowflakes and engraved 
                                the rest. I printed a prototype on a matboard and noticed that my cuts engraved instead of cutting
                                through. I quickly realized that I had chosen the wrong red for the places I wanted to cut; 
                                therefore, I had to go back to change the color to RGB red so that the process would complete. 
                                Once I was satisfied with the prototype, I printed the final product. For more information, the
