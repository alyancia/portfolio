                            <li>
                                We took a tour of Google where we learned about 
                                the some of current projects Google was working on. We were able to speak with 
                                employees at Google to get an insight of how it is like working at the company. 
                                Later we also visited SCU where we took a tour of their Engineering department 
                                and visited a majority of the of the Engineering Disciplines.

                                We listened to UC Davis' presentation covering the application details, why UC Davis 
                                is the school to go to, student life, and many more. We had the opportunity to attend 
                                a tour exploring the campus.

                                He is the Director of 
                                the New Opportunities Office at the Ames research center. They make innovative 
                                technologies and interdisciplinary scientific discoveries. One project they had was 
                                the Cube Sat (small satellites). They also came up with a way to see and find plants. 
                                They developed a technology to detect the drop in light. Only if a planet is in the 
                                habitual zone, can it have life. There used to be a thought that Earth was outside of 
                                this zone but it is not true because the atmosphere was not taken into consideration. 
                                Kepler found 1200+ planetary candidates and named the closest earth size rocky planet 
                                Kepler 186+.

                                and Development at Calpine Corporation. She majored in Industrial Engineering. She 
                                formerly worked at PG&E as the Renewable Transactions Senior Analyst with the Energy 
                                Procurement Rotational Program. At Calpine Corporation, she started as a manager in 2011 
                                then made her way to become a director in 2016. She works on business development strategies 
                                for the West Region. They combined the cycle, co generation, renewable, and energy storage. 
                                A project she worked on was the California Independent System Operator (CAISO). CAISO was 
                                responsible for managing California's Wholesale energy market and kept most of the states 
                                lights on. Under this system, there are 700+ power plants, 30000+ transmission lines, 30+ 
                                million consumers. Calpine's fleet has 82 power plants in operation/construction with 27000 
                                megawatts of capacity in 20+ states and Canada to power 21 million homes. In the west, 
                                there is enough power to fill 10% of states peak power demand. The Delta Energy Center is 
                                the largest power plant in the Bay Area at 88 megawatts.
