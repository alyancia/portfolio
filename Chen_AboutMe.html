                                The increasing amount of jobs revolving around technology led me
                                to take an interest in the STEM field. I would like to enter either the 
                                medical or technology field. Science and engineering peak my interest
                                and I would like to pursue a career on either of these two 
                                fields. Also, the medicine and engineering fields are making many
                                advancements and I would like to be part of that. I plan to study 
                                both Biology, Chemistry, Calculus, Computer Science and any other academic courses 
                                required for this career path. Furthermore, I will look for 
                                internships and volunteer opportunities related to these two fields.

                                I am a hard worker and passionate about what I do. I have the ability 
                                to type fast and can work extremely well with others. I have previously 
                                worked with elementary school students in several volunteer opportunities 
                                and have shown my skill to work with all ages. I actively participate 
                                in all group activities including sports and projects. Furthermore, I have 
                                excellent time management skills. Due to the many rigorous courses I currently 
                                take, I must balance my time out to ensure to completion of all assignments.
